  "Type": "Small Ground Unit",
  "Description": "Marines are the all-purpose infantry unit produced from a Barracks. Having  the quickest and cheapest production of all Terran units make the Mineral backbone that scales very well with Stimpack, Engineering Bay upgrades and Medivacs from the Starport. Before Stimpack, Marines are less than effective against Zerglings and Zealots; at least one Bunker and Supply Depots to wall-off is recommended for the early game. However, Marines can take advantage of kiting and Stutter Stepping from distance.  In the Mid-Late Game, high health Marauders or Hellbats can be used to Tank damage for the lower health Marines. Medivacs can also Load 8 Marines per ship to harass the opposing bases and use unpassable ground to retreat behind safely.",

  "Competitive Usage": {
    "General": "Can be used for a fast two base timing with the first 2 Medivacs and Stimpack (usually timed to finish together) for harassing or early pressure with a quick retreat. Can be combined with the firepower of Siege Tanks or Widow Mines and lose some mobility for more firepower.",
    "Vs. Protoss": "Marines have massive swings in army value, due to how much better they get once stim is done and how much worse they get when Colossi or High Templars are out for the Protoss. The Sentry's Guardian Shield effectively cuts the damage done by the marine by 1/3. Caution must be exercised with Marines and and Widow Mines when around Colossi and High Templars with their area effect damage. Colossi are hard countered by Vikings, while High Templar have a weird \"counters each other thing\" going on with Ghosts and EMP Round ability. Marines gain an additional role once Medivacs are added to the Terran army. Protoss units generally benefit from being near each other and supporting each other, leading to a Death Ball style of play. By loading small groups of Marines into Medivacs, you can stop Protoss from taking riskier and distance mining bases too far out the way for a ground army to defend effectively.",
    "Vs. Terran": "Combat Shielded Marines will survive a fight with a Stimpack-upgraded Marine with 7 HP. Combat Shield also takes less time to research, so in early Marine vs Marine skirmishes, one should not necessarily get the Stimpack upgrade first by default in TvT. Against Banshees it is recommended to get at least one Viking or Cyclone, as marines can lack the range and speed to finish off a banshee fleeing from a scan. Against Battlecruisers if there are more air armor upgrades than bio attack upgrades, the DPS of the Marines is cut down by a third so it is important to keep upgrading. Ravens or Vikings are recommended to stop them from teleporting or to kill them. In most TvT matches, the early and mid game involves trying to force your opponent to unsiege the tanks so that agile-yet-fragile marines can stim in without dying. A Sieged Tank does 40 (+4) damage to marines, so with 0/0 and stimmed marines, the tank will one shot them, but two shot them if the marines have CS or aren't stimmed. However, they can kill marines that have CS and have been stimmed in a single shot, if both sides have 3/3 and the marine isn't healed by a medivac. Due to splash damage it will kill 3-6 marines in total if marines are clumped up. If there is a lump of sieged tanks with no supporting units, medivacs can drop marines in-between the tanks, causing them to kill each other through friendly fire.",
    "Vs. Zerg": "Marines are often the core component of a TvZ army, due to their cheapness and high DPS. Siege Tanks and Widow Mines are needed to accompany the marines to thwart Banelings once Centrifugal Hooks is done. If one loses their Marines, Mutalisks will reign superior and either kill all your units and end the game, or contain you and gain superior map control. Once upgrades and Medivacs come into play, Marines will be very effective against Zerglings and Mutalisks, therefore requiring the Zerg to increase the Baneling count. Lurkers are quite strong against marines, so Marauders or extra Tanks are used to help out. Ghosts or Liberators can counter them more effectively, however. Marines barely scratch Ultralisks once Chitinous Plating is done, so Marauders, Ghosts, or Liberators are important. Fungal Growth will quickly kill marines, so watch out for that. Ghosts can EMP the Infestors out of the fight, while Tanks will out range them if spotted."
